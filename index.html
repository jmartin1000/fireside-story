    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>I was searching for my friend Jeny everywhere. She is been missing for the past one day.</p>
    <p>When she didn't show up for class, we all became concerned. But because I am a skilled operative of the Indian Secret 
      Serivces, I volunteered to find her. I had a deep suspicion that her disappearance had something to do with the video footage
      she recently obtained.

    <p>Who might be resposible? Maybe the lady in the video who is laughing always. I need sometime to think. When did I meet her last?</p>

      <h6>Flashback!</h6>
      <p> Ah! It's coming back to me. It was NOT another stormy night. In fact, it was a beautiful fall day,
        and I was at a local festival. It was a bike festival, which is why I was riding my bike. But I was in disguise.
        Already at my young age, I knew the danger of them spotting me. I literally dashed into her. She was riding a pink mountain bike, but when I ran 
        into her, I knocked her right off that bike and into the grass beside the pavement.
      </p>
      <p>She had been wearing a backpack and balancing a water bottle on her head. And as strange as that seems,
        the even stranger part was that when she stood up after her tumble, her backpack was on the ground beside the bike,
        but her water bottle was still balanced on her head. 
      </p>
      <p>While I gawked, she collected her backpack, remounted her bike, and promptly pedalled off. The water
        bottle never fell off her head. 
      </p> 
    </div>
    <p>Since that time, I have never seen her without that water bottle. Perhaps it is more accurate to say 
      that I have never seen that water bottle without her. Until yesterday. When we saw her water bottle
      in the parking lot, with no sign of her, we knew that something was up.
