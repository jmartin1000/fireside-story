    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>I was searching for my friend Jeny everywhere. She is been missing for the past one day.</p>
    <p>When she didn't show up for class, we all became concerned. But because I am a skilled operative of the Indian Secret 
      Serivces, I volunteered to find her. I had a deep suspicion that her disappearance had something to do with the video footage
      she recently obtained.

      <p>primary leads in the case</p>
      <p>two very sketchy characters</p>

    <p>Who might be resposible? Maybe the lady in the video who is laughing always. I need sometime to think. When did I meet her last?</p>

      <h6>Flashback!</h6>
      <p> Ah! It's coming back to me. It was NOT another stormy night. In fact, it was a beautiful fall day,
        and I was at a local festival. It was a bike festival, which is why I was riding my bike. But I was in disguise.
        Already at my young age, I knew the danger of them spotting me. I literally dashed into her. She was riding a pink mountain bike.
